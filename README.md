This a small web app built with Spotify's Web API. Users log in and authorise with Spotify. They can then search for songs and when a song is played it displays that song's lyrics on screen.

This is the repository for the frontend. If you want to see the backend code, you can find it [here](https://github.com/dalebandoni/spotify-lyrics-backend).
